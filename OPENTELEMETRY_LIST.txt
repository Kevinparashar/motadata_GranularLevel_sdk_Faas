OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Packages - Python SDK

INSTRUMENTATION PACKAGES (7 packages):

REQUIRED (5 packages):
1. opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx
2. opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
3. opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi
4. opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg
5. opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis (works with Dragonfly - Redis-compatible)

RECOMMENDED (2 packages):
6. opentelemetry-instrumentation-sqlalchemy
7. opentelemetry-instrumentation-uvicorn

EXPORTER PACKAGES (1 required):

REQUIRED:
8. opentelemetry-exporter-otlp - OTLP exporter to send traces/metrics to backend

INSTALLATION:
pip install opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis opentelemetry-instrumentation-sqlalchemy opentelemetry-instrumentation-uvicorn opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

TOTAL: 8 packages (6 required + 2 recommended)

NOTE: 
- LLM API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic) are automatically traced via HTTP instrumentation
- Vector database (PostgreSQL + pgvector) is ALREADY COVERED by asyncpg instrumentation
- Custom AI components (Agents Framework, RAG System, ML Framework) need MANUAL instrumentation using OpenTelemetry SDK (no pre-built packages exist)
- OTLP exporter is required to send traces to your observability backend (OTEL Collector, Jaeger, etc.)

WHAT'S COVERED:
✅ Vector database operations - Covered by opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg (pgvector is PostgreSQL extension)
✅ LLM API calls - Covered by HTTP instrumentation (httpx/requests)
✅ Database queries - Covered by asyncpg instrumentation
✅ Cache operations (Dragonfly) - Covered by opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis (Dragonfly is Redis-compatible, uses aioredis)

WHAT NEEDS MANUAL INSTRUMENTATION:
⚠️ Agents Framework - Custom framework, use OpenTelemetry SDK directly
⚠️ RAG System - Custom implementation, use OpenTelemetry SDK directly
⚠️ ML Framework - Custom implementation, use OpenTelemetry SDK directly
⚠️ Prompt Management - Custom component, use OpenTelemetry SDK directly
