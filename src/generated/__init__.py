Generated Code Package

This package contains auto-generated code (e.g., Protocol Buffer files).
Generated code is excluded from code coverage.

IMPORTANT: This directory is for AUTO-GENERATED code only.
- Protocol Buffer files (*_pb2.py, *_pb2_grpc.py) will be generated here
- Code generator output (*_gen.py) will be placed here
- DO NOT manually write code in this directory
- Regenerate from source .proto files when needed
